Project 1 Written Report:

By: Spencer Duke, Joshua Mayo, Christopher McCormick

In this report, we looked into Utah population data and how Utah's growing population has affected Utah's workforce over the past 5 years. 

Our data source for this report came form Utah's Department of Workforce Services. We pulled two separate sources from this site:
1. Utah population data
2. Utah industry data

The timeframe for this analysis was the folowing 5-year span: Jan 1, 2017 - Dec 31,2021

The questions we were aiming to answer were:
1. How much has Utahâ€™s total population and working population changed?
2. How has the growth in population affected Utah's employment-to-population ratio?
3. Has the population growth had a positive or negative impact on the various industry sectors?

To answer the first question, we uploaded Utah population data and created a bar graph displaying total populaiton over time. The resulting graph showed a clear increase year-over-year for a total population increase of 7.08% from 2017-2021. 

To answer the second quesiton, we uplpoaded, joined, and cleaned Utah workforce data for every year within our timeframe. We then calculated total working population of Utah for every year and, like the previous question, created a bar graph using that data. We found that, in correclation with population data, there was a clear increase year-over-year in total working population as well. The only exception to this was the year 2020 where the working population decreased by a notable measure. This, however, should be considered an outlier due to the worldwide Covid 19 pandemic that affected working populations all across the globe in 2020. 

After making that bar graph, we decided to make two separate pie charts comparing Utah total population to Utah total working population for the years 2017 and 2021. The pie chart for 2017 data showed that 46.5% of the state's population was employed in 2017. The 2021 pie chart showed that 47.7% of the state's population was employed in 2021. This means that even as Utah's population increased by a large measure over the 5-year span, the percentage of working individuals within the state increased, which suggests that the increasing population had a positive impact on Utah's economy. 

To further explore this and answer our third question, we wanted to narrow down which of Utah's industry sectors were most positively affected by the growing population, and which were most negatively affected. To begin, we found the top three industry sectors that experienced the most growth by calulating the percent change in working population for each industry sector and filtering by greatest percent increase from 2017. These top three indsutry sectors that experienced the most growth were:
(1) Construction - 25.25% increase
(2) Real Estate and Rental and Leasing - 24.63% increase
(3) Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services - 16.61% increase

Next, we found the the bottom three industry sectors that experienced the least/negative growth using the same calculation but filtering for bottom three values instead. These sectors were:
(1) Educaitonal Service - 1.99% increase
(2) Utilities - 3.47% decrease
(3) Information - 3.56% decrease

To visualize these findings, we created two separate line graphs containing each set of top performing and bottom performing industry sectors. These graphs showed percent increase/decrease for every year, using the year 2017 as a base metric. 

In conclusion, we found that (based on the parameters defined in this analysis) Utah's growing population has had a net-positive effect on Utah's economy. There is more workforce participation, and extremely high growth in several industry sectors, with stagnation or only slight losses in other industry sectors.
